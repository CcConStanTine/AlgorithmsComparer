# AlgorithmsComparer

Project was created for classes from C# language. The task was to create something what will show the exemplary usage of multithreading and parallel programming. 

The project has 20 pages of documentation (<a href="https://github.com/CcConStanTine/AlgorithmsComparer/blob/master/Pawe%C5%82_Karpiel_dokumentacja_projektu_C%23.odt">link</a> to the file, unfortunately you have to download it), so I think there is no need of repeating this here.
